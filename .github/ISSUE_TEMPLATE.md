### Is this a bug report?

(write your answer here)

  If you answered "Yes":

    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps.

    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with

  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.
